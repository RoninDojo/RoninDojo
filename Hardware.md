# Ronin Dojo Hardware

When selecting hardware to build your Rpi4 Dojo here is a list of items needed and their requirements. 

### Raspberry Pi 4 4gb

The 4gb model is required to run all of the features of the Ronin Dojo stack

### Micro SD card 16-32gb

### USB/Micro SD adapter for flashing OS

### 1TB HDD/SSD 

1TB is the minimum suggested to run the stack, preferably an SSD for speed, especially during IBD(initial block download) 

### Case

Active cooling is highly recommended, load/temps get high during IBD validation. If you do want to use passive cooling get a high quality case. 

### Power supply 

### HDMI->Micro HDMI cable

Can be used with initial OS setup, you can SSH into the device after. _*Work is being done on being able to set the device up via SSH from the beginning._
